# Poet's Dashboard Application

> This is a Ruby On Rails 5 application that is designed for blogs and Portfolio management
> This was my personal project. It was a web application, that allowed to
  share a poet's literature through the web. The application allowed the Poet
  to publish his blogs, portfolio, and upload his podcasts and video contents.
  This was also a project that I did intending to touch the literature discipline,
  and hence promote the literature in the country.
